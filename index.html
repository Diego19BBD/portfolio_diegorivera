  <p>This web portfolio includes examples of my
    work in Mr. Lanus' Web Design Class. It also
    includes my reflection on what I learned in
    each unit of the course.</p>


  <h2>Unit 1: HTML</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>What do you think are the most important vocabulary terms (or key concepts) in this unit? What do you think that they mean?</li>
     <ul>
       <li>The most important vocabulary terms are paragraph, div, main, unordered list. They are all part of putting a great webpage together from scratch.</li>
       </ul>

    <li>What do you think are the most important skills that you learned in this unit of study?</li>
     <ul>
       <li>The most important skills that I have learned in this unit is lists because they allow us to be able to display more information to the user.</li>
     </ul>

    <li>In what ways have you gotten better at this kind of work?</li>
     <ul>
       <li>I have gotten better than I was before because now I understand the way to build my website out of noting, before I had no clue what to do.</li>
       </ul>

      <li>In what ways do you think you need to improve?</li>
       <ul>
         <li>The way that I can improve is by being able to make my website have design to it so that it looks presentable and people are shocked on how good it looks</li>
         </ul>

        <li>What problems did you encounter while you were working on this piece? How did you solve them?</li>
         <ul>
           <li>The problems that I encountered when I was working on this piece was I put a div where it wasn't suppose to be and it bolded my work</li>
           </ul>

          <li>What was especially satisfying to you about either the process or the finished product?</li>
           <ul>
             <li>The thing that was most satisfying is that I was able to do something that I was not able to do anymore</li>
             </ul>

            <li>If you were the teacher, what comments would you make about this piece?
             <ul>
               <li>The comments that I would make is that it's getting there but you can still use some work to make it look like a godd well designed page</li>
               </ul>
            </ol>
